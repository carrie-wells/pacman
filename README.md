# Pac-Man Factory
This program allows the users to create multiple Pac-Men that move across the screen at different rates. The Pac-Men bounce against walls and rebound to continue moving. 
## How to Run:
Download all of the files onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into your browser. Click "Add Pacman" for each Pacman you would like to add. Click "Start Game" to watch them move around your screen.

## Future Improvements:
Create Pac-man of varying colors; Add other Pac-man related elements, like ghosts and cherries; Make the Pac-Men change direction when they hit an edge
